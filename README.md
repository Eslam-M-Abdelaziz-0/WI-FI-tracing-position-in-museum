# WI-FI-tracing-position-in-museum
I use network of access points to get indoor position, then sent information automatically about this position.

Network of access points will be used:  in order to calculate the coordinates, 
wifi routers will be used to simulate the GPS system inside the museum.  
Wifi routers signals will be used instead of satellite signals in order to calculate the location of the mobile, i.e. 
the tourist, accurately at museum indoors.
